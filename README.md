#MicroGrad - A Minimalistic Autograd Engine
MicroGrad is a lightweight Python implementation of an automatic differentiation engine for 
building and training simple neural networks. 
It provides a hands-on approach to learning how backpropagation works under the hood.

This project is heavily inspired by Andrej Karpathy's MicroGrad.
It's a great way to learn about autodiff and neural network basics.
